# A Parameter-Free Differential Evolution Algorithm for the Analytic Continuation of Imaginary Time Correlation Functions

Nathan S. Nichols, Paul Sokol, Adrian Del Maestro

[arXiv:XXXX.YYYYY](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY)

### Abstract
We report on Differential Evolution for Analytic Continuation (DEAC): a parameter-free evolutinary algorithm to generate the dynamic structure factor from imaginary time correlation functions. Our approach to this long-standing problem in quantum many-body physics achieves enhanced spectral fidelity while using fewer compute (CPU) hours. The need for fine-tuning of algorithmic control parameters is eliminated by embedding them within the genome to be optimized for this evolutionary computation based algorithm.  Benchmarks are presented for models where the dynamic structure factor is known exactly, and experimentally relevant results are included for quantum Monte Carlo simulations of bulk $^4$He below the superfluid transition temperature. 

### Description
This repository includes links, code, scripts, and data to generate the figures in a paper.

### Requirements
The data in this project was generated via path integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and analytic continuation techniques.  Everything included in the [data](https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/papers-code-DEAC/tree/main/data) directory was generated via:

* [DEAC: A C++ implementaion of the differential evolution for analytic continuation algorithm](https://github.com/nscottnichols/deac-cpp)
* [DEAC.jl: A Julia implementaion of the differential evolution for analytic continuation algorithm](https://github.com/nscottnichols/DEAC.jl)
* [FESOM.jl: A Julia implementaion of the fast and efficient stochastic optimization method](https://github.com/nscottnichols/FESOM.jl)
* [MEM.jl: A Julia implementaion of the maximum entropy method](https://github.com/nscottnichols/MEM.jl)
* [PIMC: A C++ path integral quantum Monte Carlo implementation](https://code.delmaestro.org/)
